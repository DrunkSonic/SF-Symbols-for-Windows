## How it works
The file in this project is a .ttf font file that can be used on Windows or any system that supports .ttf files. Simply download and install this file, and you'll have a basic version of SF Symbols you can use in most applications that allow text input with custom fonts installed on your device.

Once the file is installed, you cannot use basic characters (such as the keys on your keyboard) to render any symbols. Instead, you'll have to open your [Character Map](C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\System Tools) application (if you're on a Windows system) or a similar program in order to view the glyphs. If you need more help or clarification, instructions for installation and usage can be found below.

Once installed and you've figured out how to use it, here's some ideas on how you can productively use these symbols. Remember, these are for **personal usage** only.

- _Use in documents._ You can spruce up your documents by including these symbols in it. You can use them in almost all programs that support typing in custom fonts (that aren't limited to a small selection defined by the program itself). For example, you can use it in Wordpad, Microsoft Word, and WPS Office.
- _Use in prototype UI designs._ If you need a temporary placeholder icon set, it's much easier and more flexible to use a font rather than images in your UI design. A common example you can use this font in is in Figma, which allows for better and smoother editing and prototyping.
- _Video and photo editing._ You can use this icon set in videos and photos to allow for better audience engagement. Despite the restrictions of going commerical with most use cases including this icon set without permission from Apple, you should be able to use it in YouTube videos. If you're experienced with this enough, you can even try to animate them to make things even more engaging and immersive.
- _Animation._ You can even try to animate these symbols for a countless number of reasons. If you're really good, maybe you can use Blender or some other sort of 3D software to create something more complex.
- _Presentations._ Make your next office presentation big. You can use PowerPoint or WPS Office to
