# SF-Symbols-for-Windows
A Windows compatible .ttf font file containing over 6,000 symbols and glyphs from Apple's default icon library, used in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

## How it works
The file in this project is a .ttf font file that can be used on Windows or any system that supports .ttf files. Simply download and install this file, and you'll have a basic version of SF Symbols you can use in most applications that allow text input with custom fonts installed on your device.

Once the file is installed, you cannot use basic characters (such as the keys on your keyboard) to render any symbols. Instead, you'll have to open your Character Map app (if you're on a Windows system) or a similar program in order to view the glyphs and icons contained in the font file. If you need more help or clarification, instructions for installation and usage can be found below.

Once installed and you've figured out how to use it, here's some ideas on how you can productively use these symbols. Remember, these are for **personal usage** only.

- _Use in documents._ You can spruce up your documents by including these symbols in it. You can use them in almost all programs that support typing in custom fonts (that aren't limited to a small selection defined by the program itself). For example, you can use it in Wordpad, Microsoft Word, and WPS Office.
- _Use in prototype UI designs._ If you need a temporary placeholder icon set, it's much easier and more flexible to use a font rather than images in your UI design. A common example you can use this font in is in Figma, which allows for better and smoother editing and prototyping.
- _Video and photo editing._ You can use this icon set in videos and photos to allow for better audience engagement. Despite the restrictions of going commerical with most use cases including this icon set without permission from Apple, you should be able to use it in YouTube videos. If you're experienced with this enough, you can even try to animate them to make things even more engaging and immersive.
- _Animation._ You can even try to animate these symbols for a countless number of reasons. If you're really good, maybe you can use Blender or some other sort of 3D software to create something more complex.
- _Presentations._ Make your next office presentation big. You can use PowerPoint or WPS Office to impress your classmates and coworkers.

## How to use it
These instructions are assuming you're using **Windows 10 and up**. If you're not, you can try to follow along this guide if needed (though it's very basic) and adjust these steps to correspond with your system.
1. In the field above this readme file, click on the `SF-Symbols.ttf` file.
2. In the toolbar, click the download icon to install the file to your device. Ensure your system or intended programs for usage can handle .ttf files installed on your system.
3. Depending on the program you're planning on using this icon set in, determine how the program allows you to choose your custom fonts. For example, if it allows you to select a `.ttf` file from your system (meaning in all directories), you don't need to proceed further, though it's still highly recommended to actually install the font. However, if your program prompts you to select a font from only the `C:\Windows\Fonts\` folder, you'll need to follow steps for the rest of the guide. Locate the file you just downloaded and double-click on it. If it's in a .ZIP file, you can do the same thing, because it only contains one font file. No need to extract it â€” we're not downloading an entire font family.
4. A window called **Windows Font Viewer** or one with a similar name should open. Click on the _Install_ button.
5. Wait for the font to install to your system.
6. Press `Win + R` on your keyboard and type `charmap`. You can also type `charmap` and open it from the Start Menu.
7. Under the dropdown labeled _Font_, select  `SF-Symbols`. You should now see a collection of all the possible glyphs in your font.
> [!NOTE]
> You may see some duplicate or missing icons. This is a parsing error and will likely not be fixed. However, there's plenty of alternate ones you can find.
8. In the grid, select the icon(s) you'd like to use until its size is emphasized and then click _Select_, located to the right of the text input area at the bottom of the window labeled "Characters to copy."
9. Click _Copy_ once you've gotten your character(s).
10. In your program, all you need to do is set the font to `Sf-Symbols.ttf `, then paste in the character using `Ctrl + V` into your text area. From there, you can customize size, color, and more effects with whatever your program allows.

## An easier way to browse through symbols!
Instead of digging through Character Map with no point of reference to help you find the one you're looking for, here's a [website](https://tuffluck761.wixsite.com/sf-symbols-guide) created by me that allows you to filter symbols by their characteristics! Just double click on a specific symbol at anytime to copy it to your clipboard using **Ctrl + C** and **Ctrl + V**!

Please note, this site is in early development and some parts and functionality may not work. The vast majority of symbols in this collection are not assigned names (which aren't official) or tags yet, so you won't yet be able to find most of them using filters. However, you can still browse through most of them and use **Ctrl + F** to search for a keyword (though you'll need to load all symbols using the _Load more_ button, assuming the symbol you're looking for already has an assigned name. Hopefully, this site will be complete shortly!
